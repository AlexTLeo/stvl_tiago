# Analysis of the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer (STVL)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Introduction
In this analysis, the performance of the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer was tested according to several relevant benchmarks:
- one
- two
- three
- more

## Procedure
### 1. Installation
Firstly, we installed the _[Galactic Geochelone]_(https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/index.html) distribution of **ROS2**.

On top of that, we installed the ROS2 **Navigation 2 Framework v2.1.0.0**, alongside the STVL plugin, which was then added to the simulation parameter .yaml file.

More specifically, we used the **nav2_bringup** simulation, and we added the STVL layers as plugins to the **nav2_params.yaml**.

The simulation was run on [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home)
