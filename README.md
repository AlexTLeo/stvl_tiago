# Analysis of the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer (STVL)
====================================================
## Introduction
In this analysis, the performance of the Spatio-Temporal Voxel Layer was tested according to several relevant benchmarks:
- one
- two
- three
- more

## Procedure
### Installation
Firstly, we installed the _Galactic Geochelone_ distribution of **ROS2**. On top of that, we installed v2.1.0 of the ROS2 **Navigation 2 Framework**, alongside the STVL plugin, which was then added to the simulation parameter .yaml file.
More specifically, we used the **nav2_bringup** simulation, and we added the STVL layers as plugins to the **nav2_params.yaml**.
